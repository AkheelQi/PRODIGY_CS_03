# PRODIGY_CS_03
A simple python code to check your password complexity.


Criteria Check: The script checks if the password meets the following criteria:
-Length of at least 8 characters.
-Contains uppercase letters.
-Contains lowercase letters.
-Contains numbers.
-Contains special characters.
Strength Calculation: The script calculates a score based on the number of criteria met and converts this score into a percentage.
Feedback: Based on the score, the script provides feedback on the password’s strength (e.g., “Very Strong”, “Strong”, etc.) along with the percentage indicator.
Loop for Multiple Checks: The script continuously prompts the user to enter a password and provides feedback. After each check, it asks if the user wants to check another password. If the user responds with “yes,” the script prompts for another password; otherwise, it exits.
